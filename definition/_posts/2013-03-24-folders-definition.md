# Introduction

A Folder is a container for Items. The set of Folders should be in an organized way that becomes a hierarchical Tree.

## Access rights

Each folder can be associated to specific access rights for Users and/or Users Group.

By default, a sub-folder inherits the rights from its top-folder.  

# Actions on a Folder

Depending on the User rights, a User may be able to:

* Create a Folder
* Rename a Folder
* Delete a Folder
* Move a Folder

In all cases, this can be performed either by 'Managing Folders' page or by 'Items' page.

How to perform those actions? See [THIS]() page.

<i class="fa fa-warning" style="margin-right:10px;"></i>In case of folder deletion, all sub-folders and Items will also be deleted.
