# Main Changes

Release 2.1.23 introduces an interface major change, some technical improvements and bug fixes.

## Interface changes

The home page has now disappeared from Teampass. The user is directly redirected to the Items page.
This feature was something asked by a lot of users, and it goes in the direction Teampass will tend to in the future 2.2 version.

* ![Items page]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015-01-25 11_27_32-Collaborative_Passwords_Manager.png)

In the top menu, 2 new menus have been added, one for the last viewed items and the other one for actions related the user session.

One menu button has been added for the 3 main areas of the Items page.

### Folders area

The menu button gives access to actions on folders (creation, edition and deletion), and to specific actions such as importing, exporting, and off-line mode. Those last 3 actions depend on administration activation.

### Current folder area

The menu button gives access to actions on Items (creation, edition, copying and deletion).

### Current item area

The menu button gives access to actions on selected Item.

### Read only folders

The read-only folder are identified with the eye icon in front of the Folder name.


## New password library introduction

A new library for password generation and encryption [PasswordLib] (https://github.com/ircmaxell/PHP-PasswordLib) is now part of the Teampass package. 
For this release, only the password generator is used but its encryption classes will be introduced in next Teampass release.
