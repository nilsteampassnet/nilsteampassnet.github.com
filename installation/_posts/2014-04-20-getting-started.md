</p>
<span class="linkmore"></span>

# Pre-requisite

You need first need to install Teampass on your server.

# Creating Folders

The first step is to create Folders in which the Items will be added.
Those folders have to be organized in a logical way for your need.

Refer to page [Managing Folders] ({{ site.baseurl }}/administration/managing-folders.html).

# Creating Roles

The second step consists in 2 activities:

* creating Roles in which your Users will be added
* set the access rights of Roles versus Folders

Refer to page [Managing Folders] ({{ site.baseurl }}/administration/managing-roles.html).

# Creating Users

The third step consists in creating Users that will use Teampass.

You need to think about a global strategy relating the Folders, Roles and Users level.

Refer to page [Managing Folders] ({{ site.baseurl }}/administration/managing-users.html).

# Remember

> Remember that an Administrator has no access to Items.

In order to test your set-up, it is recommended to create a dummy account user which you will use to test your Teampass configuration.

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> In some case, you could need to make the Administrators becoming `normal users`.
